This is a test project that I have worked on in my free time to help sharpen my skills as a developer. This project offers much more than just an eccomerce app.
It offers: Expense Tracker, Fittness Calculator, Loan/Mortgage Calculator, TicTacToe, Two fully different different ecommerce sites, contact us page, about us page,
fully functional custom header and footer, class and model demonstration, component utilization, C# methods, html and css demonstration, telerik utilization and
more. 

This project helps to demonstrate some of talents through many uses of logic like in the TicTacToe game or the understanding of the entire front end
through the styling and creation of the app. 

REMINDER- This is just a test projec that I have created on my free time, it is not final product or fully demonstrates all of my abilities to 
the full potential.
